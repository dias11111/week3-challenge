# week3-challenge
•	What was the challenge? 
- convert integers into string. 
•	How I expected the challenge to go. 
-	I expected the normal task to be very stretched out because we had to write ones, tens and hundreds. 1-999
•	What went well? 
-	After managing to figure out how to change into tens then it started making more sense.
•	What didn't go as planned?
-	 It got little confusing when I was trying to change words into tens.
